## Future proof

What is Malzahar gets insanly OP with AfterShock rune?

The program is coded so you should never have to update it (unless riot does something) and if i know about it i will add it to the program and the next time you open it it will be there.

Also if i have made any mistakes at all please put them as issues here or post in the reddit post, i will fix it asap.
